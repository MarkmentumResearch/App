Bottom Line: Macro posture shows a mixed backdrop where falling yields, firm bonds, strong gold, and a soft energy complex point to easing growth and receding inflation pressure even as the flat dollar and pro‑cyclical sector participation temper the signal, leaving the tape consistent with a market leaning into lower-rate support rather than a pure growth reacceleration.
