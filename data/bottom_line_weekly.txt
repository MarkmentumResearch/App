Bottom Line: Macro posture shows growth expectations holding up but becoming more selective while inflation and policy-rate expectations stay firm or even edge higher, as evidenced by rising yields, a stronger USD, underperforming bonds and the energy complex, and concurrent strength in gold acting more as a hedge against policy and macro uncertainty than as a clean reflation signal, which the equity tape partially validates via cyclicals over secular growth but contradicts via the sharp drawdown in the broader energy complex.
