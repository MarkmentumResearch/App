Bottom Line: Macro posture shows markets are pricing a mix of firmer growth and stickier inflation pressures—higher yields alongside a strong USD, rising gold, and an advancing energy complex with largely flat bonds—leaving the week’s tape consistent with a modestly pro-growth but inflation-aware stance rather than an outright risk-off or disinflation trade.
