    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Monthly Market Read: February 02, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 57.3% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: leading (avg +1.48%)</li>
<li>Financials: firm (avg +0.47%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: lagging (avg -0.51%)</li>
<li>Health Care: firm (avg +0.31%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +1.60%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +1.12%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: firm (avg +0.39%)</li>
<li>Energy: lagging (avg -2.22%)</li>
<li>Utilities: lagging (avg -1.37%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: lagging (avg -1.18%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +0.61%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: soft (avg -4.00%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +0.77%)</li>
<li>Yields: leading (avg +0.70%)</li>
<li>Bonds: soft (avg -0.41%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: soft (avg -15.06%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is moderately constructive with a majority of sectors positive, and leadership concentrated in growth and cyclically sensitive groups like Tech, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, Financials, and Materials, while traditional defensives and real assets such as Energy, Utilities, Real Estate, and Communication Services lag, reinforcing a pro-risk, growth-oriented tape. Macro posture shows markets pricing firmer growth and contained-to-softening inflation pressures, with higher yields, a stronger USD, weaker bonds, soft gold, and a sharply lower energy complex aligning with the sector tilt toward growth and away from inflation-benefiting real assets, even as the underperformance in defensives suggests investors are not yet positioning for imminent macro stress.</p>
