    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Monthly Market Read: February 13, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 63.4% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: soft (avg -0.31%)</li>
<li>Financials: lagging (avg -4.41%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: lagging (avg -2.84%)</li>
<li>Health Care: leading (avg +0.51%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +1.53%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +4.63%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +6.52%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +7.15%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +7.72%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +3.21%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +9.46%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +3.97%)</li>
<li>USD: firm (avg +0.10%)</li>
<li>Yields: soft (avg -4.47%)</li>
<li>Bonds: leading (avg +1.35%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: soft (avg -15.27%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is solid with nearly two-thirds of the universe positive, but leadership is skewed toward defensives and bond-proxy sectors—Utilities, Staples, Real Estate, and Materials—alongside Energy equities, while cyclicals are more mixed as Industrials and Consumer Discretionary grind higher even as Financials and Communication Services lag and Tech trades soft. Macro posture shows the tape consistent with easing growth and moderating inflation expectations as lower yields and firmer bonds support defensives and rate-sensitives, a firm USD and slumping energy complex point away from a strong reflation impulse, and solid gold performance underscores persistent demand for hedges rather than outright cyclical risk.</p>
