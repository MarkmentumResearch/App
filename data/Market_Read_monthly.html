    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Monthly Market Read: February 27, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 65.2% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: lagging (avg -0.41%)</li>
<li>Financials: lagging (avg -4.14%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: leading (avg +1.83%)</li>
<li>Health Care: leading (avg +2.60%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +1.31%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +5.81%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +6.79%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +11.05%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +10.29%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +3.75%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +8.20%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +8.72%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +0.90%)</li>
<li>Yields: soft (avg -6.60%)</li>
<li>Bonds: leading (avg +1.92%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: soft (avg -14.38%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is constructive with roughly two-thirds of the universe positive, and leadership is unusually skewed toward defensives and bond-proxies (Staples, Utilities, Health Care, Real Estate) alongside value/cyclical pockets like Industrials, Materials, and Energy equities, while traditional growth engines in Information Technology and Financials lag, pointing to a market that is participating but still hiding in perceived safety and yield. Macro posture shows the combination of strong gold, firm USD, falling yields, positive bond performance, and a notably weak energy complex as broadly consistent with the tape’s tilt toward defensives and income, signaling a market that is pricing slowing growth with easing forward inflation pressures rather than a clean, reflationary upturn.</p>
