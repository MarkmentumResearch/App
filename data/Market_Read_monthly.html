    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Monthly Market Read: February 12, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 60.8% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: lagging (avg -2.01%)</li>
<li>Financials: lagging (avg -4.83%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: lagging (avg -3.53%)</li>
<li>Health Care: lagging (avg -0.85%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +1.24%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +3.50%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +6.44%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +5.52%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +4.89%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +1.77%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +8.88%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +1.45%)</li>
<li>USD: firm (avg +0.15%)</li>
<li>Yields: soft (avg -3.42%)</li>
<li>Bonds: leading (avg +1.05%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: soft (avg -15.20%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is constructive with just over 60% of the universe positive, and leadership has rotated toward classic defensives and bond proxies—Staples, Utilities, Real Estate—alongside Materials and Energy equities, while cyclical growth engines like Tech, Financials, and Communications are lagging and Discretionary is only modestly ahead, all pointing to a tape that favors safety, income, and hard-asset balance sheets over higher-duration earnings stories. Macro posture shows that softer yields, bid bonds, a mildly firm USD, resilient gold, and a sharply weaker energy complex together signal cooling growth and moderating forward inflation pressures, which the sector pattern is validating via outperformance in defensives and rate-sensitives rather than in the high-beta cyclicals.</p>
