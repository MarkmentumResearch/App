    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Monthly Market Read: February 17, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 63.2% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: lagging (avg -1.46%)</li>
<li>Financials: lagging (avg -3.60%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: lagging (avg -2.67%)</li>
<li>Health Care: firm (avg +0.39%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +1.46%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +4.81%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +4.58%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +5.93%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +7.43%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +4.11%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +8.11%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +0.73%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +0.35%)</li>
<li>Yields: soft (avg -4.60%)</li>
<li>Bonds: leading (avg +1.39%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: soft (avg -17.18%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is constructive with roughly two-thirds of the universe positive, but the leadership profile is defensive and late-cycle, with cyclically sensitive Industrials and Consumer Discretionary sharing the podium with classic defensives like Staples, Utilities, Real Estate, and Materials, while key growth and financial beta pockets—Technology, Financials, and Communication Services—are all lagging. Macro posture shows the tape and macro levers collectively leaning toward easing growth and cooling inflation expectations, with falling yields, firm bonds, a resilient USD, modestly higher gold, and a sharply weaker energy complex signaling a downshift in nominal pressure that aligns with the outperformance of defensives and rate-sensitives over traditional cyclicals and high-duration growth.</p>
