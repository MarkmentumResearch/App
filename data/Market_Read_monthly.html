    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Monthly Market Read: February 04, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 62.2% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: lagging (avg -2.40%)</li>
<li>Financials: soft (avg -0.34%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: lagging (avg -2.51%)</li>
<li>Health Care: firm (avg +0.39%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +2.18%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +3.04%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +4.11%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +3.21%)</li>
<li>Utilities: soft (avg -0.18%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: steady (avg +0.19%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +6.26%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +2.03%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +0.93%)</li>
<li>Yields: leading (avg +0.68%)</li>
<li>Bonds: soft (avg -0.44%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: soft (avg -11.21%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: With roughly two-thirds of the universe positive, breadth is constructive and the tape is rotating toward classic late-cycle, quality-and-defensive leadership, as Consumer Staples, Energy, Industrials, and Materials pace gains while growth-heavy Tech and Communication Services lag and rate-sensitives like Utilities and Financials stay soft to flat, underscoring a preference for cyclicals with pricing power and balance-sheet durability over long-duration growth. Macro posture shows markets are leaning toward slower, stickier growth with mixed but generally firm inflation expectations, as higher USD and yields alongside weaker bonds and a slumping energy complex argue against a pure inflation scare even as resilient gold and the leadership of defensives and real-asset-linked cyclicals signal demand for hedges and cash-flow visibility rather than a broad-based reflation or robust growth upswing.</p>
