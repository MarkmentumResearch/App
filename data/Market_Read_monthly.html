    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Monthly Market Read: February 18, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 65.7% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: lagging (avg -0.41%)</li>
<li>Financials: lagging (avg -2.62%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: lagging (avg -2.27%)</li>
<li>Health Care: leading (avg +1.51%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +2.51%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +5.10%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +5.12%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +7.69%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +5.63%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +3.24%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +8.71%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +3.00%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +0.96%)</li>
<li>Yields: soft (avg -3.89%)</li>
<li>Bonds: leading (avg +1.23%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: soft (avg -14.95%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is solid with roughly two-thirds of the universe positive, and leadership has rotated toward a mix of defensives (Staples, Utilities, Health Care, Real Estate) and late-cycle cyclicals/value (Industrials, Materials, Energy equities), while classic growth and financial beta (Tech, Financials, Communication Services) are lagging despite strong Consumer Discretionary. Macro posture shows markets are pricing softer growth and easing inflation pressures—evident in falling yields, bid for bonds, firm USD, and notably weak energy complex—tempered by a concurrent bid for gold that speaks to lingering macro and policy uncertainty rather than a clean risk-on growth acceleration.</p>
