    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Monthly Market Read: February 03, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 57.7% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: lagging (avg -1.39%)</li>
<li>Financials: lagging (avg -1.40%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: lagging (avg -2.88%)</li>
<li>Health Care: soft (avg -0.37%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +0.91%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +1.72%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +1.99%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +0.77%)</li>
<li>Utilities: steady (avg +0.20%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: lagging (avg -1.67%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +3.09%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +2.10%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +0.69%)</li>
<li>Yields: leading (avg +0.62%)</li>
<li>Bonds: soft (avg -0.30%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: soft (avg -12.89%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is constructive with roughly three-fifths of the universe positive, and leadership is rotating toward cyclicals and defensives together—Materials, Industrials, Staples, and Consumer Discretionary are all outperforming alongside steady Utilities and resilient Energy, while classic growth and rate-sensitive groups like Tech, Financials, Communications, and Real Estate lag, signaling a preference for balance-sheet quality and cash-flow visibility over pure multiple expansion. Macro posture shows the market grappling with firmer real-rate dynamics—stronger USD, higher yields, soft bonds, and a bid in gold alongside a sharply weaker energy complex—pointing to mixed signals where growth expectations look stable-to-slowing and near-term inflation expectations are easing on commodities even as policy and currency moves keep financial conditions tight.</p>
