    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Monthly Market Read: February 11, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 67.5% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: leading (avg +0.65%)</li>
<li>Financials: lagging (avg -3.03%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: lagging (avg -1.13%)</li>
<li>Health Care: leading (avg +0.91%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +2.60%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +5.46%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +6.10%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +7.38%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +3.26%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +2.52%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +10.55%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +5.10%)</li>
<li>USD: firm (avg +0.19%)</li>
<li>Yields: soft (avg -1.72%)</li>
<li>Bonds: leading (avg +0.41%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: soft (avg -13.95%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is healthy with roughly two-thirds of the universe positive, and leadership is broad-based across cyclicals and defensives, with standout strength in Materials, Energy equities, Staples, Industrials, and Discretionary, while Financials and Communication Services lag despite supportive bond and yield dynamics. Macro posture shows mixed signals, with firm gold, softer yields, and positive bond returns pointing to moderating growth and rising risk premia amid contained inflation pressures, while a firm USD and notably weak energy complex temper the inflation impulse even as equity leadership tilts toward both real assets and defensives.</p>
