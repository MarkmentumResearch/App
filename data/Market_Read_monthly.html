    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Monthly Market Read: February 24, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 64.6% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: lagging (avg -1.74%)</li>
<li>Financials: lagging (avg -5.05%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: lagging (avg -1.28%)</li>
<li>Health Care: leading (avg +1.31%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +0.92%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +5.32%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +6.88%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +9.45%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +8.89%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +3.79%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +8.55%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +6.67%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +1.14%)</li>
<li>Yields: soft (avg -4.86%)</li>
<li>Bonds: leading (avg +1.43%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: soft (avg -15.32%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is broadly constructive with nearly two-thirds of the universe positive MTD, but leadership is decidedly defensive and quality-oriented, with Staples, Utilities, Health Care, and Real Estate outperforming alongside strong gains in Industrials and Materials, while traditional growth and financial cyclicals like Tech, Financials, and Communication Services lag. The tape is rewarding real-asset and bond-proxy exposures (Energy equities, Materials, Utilities, REITs) against a backdrop of weaker Financials and Tech, suggesting investors are favoring cash-flow visibility and duration over pure growth beta. Macro posture shows markets are pricing a mix of slower or more uncertain growth and sticky-to-rising inflation risk, as evidenced by strong Gold and USD, lower yields and higher bonds, alongside a sharply weaker energy complex that tempers, but does not fully offset, the inflation-hedging bid in defensive and real-asset sectors.</p>
