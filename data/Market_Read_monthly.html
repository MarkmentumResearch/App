    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Monthly Market Read: February 26, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 67.2% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: soft (avg -0.11%)</li>
<li>Financials: lagging (avg -2.33%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: soft (avg -0.31%)</li>
<li>Health Care: leading (avg +1.61%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +1.94%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +5.83%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +5.62%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +9.37%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +9.12%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +3.81%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +7.43%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +7.31%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +0.98%)</li>
<li>Yields: soft (avg -5.25%)</li>
<li>Bonds: leading (avg +1.67%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: soft (avg -16.18%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is solid with roughly two-thirds of names higher on the month, but leadership has rotated away from prior growth/tech winners toward a broad mix of cyclicals and defensives, with Industrials, Materials, Energy, Staples, Utilities, Real Estate, and Consumer Discretionary all outperforming while Financials and Technology lag and Communication Services trades soft. Macro posture shows markets pricing softer growth and moderating inflation pressures—signaled by falling yields, bid bonds, strong gold, and a firmer dollar alongside a sharply weaker energy complex—leaving the tape consistent with a defensive quality tilt and real-asset hedge rather than a straightforward pro-cyclical, reflationary chase.</p>
