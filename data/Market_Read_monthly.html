    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Monthly Market Read: February 25, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 66.0% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: soft (avg -0.15%)</li>
<li>Financials: lagging (avg -3.56%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: lagging (avg -1.64%)</li>
<li>Health Care: leading (avg +1.49%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +0.58%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +4.48%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +5.30%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +8.55%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +9.16%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +3.21%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +7.47%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +6.40%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +0.88%)</li>
<li>Yields: soft (avg -4.53%)</li>
<li>Bonds: leading (avg +1.46%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: soft (avg -15.55%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: With roughly two-thirds of the universe positive, breadth is constructive, but the leadership mix is defensive and rate-sensitive—Utilities, Staples, Health Care, Real Estate, and long-duration equities are outperforming alongside strong gains in Energy and Materials, while Financials and Communication Services lag and Tech is flat, signaling a market that is rewarding safety, lower rates, and select real assets rather than pure cyclicality. Macro posture shows markets are leaning toward slowing growth and easing inflation pressures, with falling yields and rising bonds, a firm USD, sharply weaker energy complex, and strong gold all pointing to a cautious, late-cycle, duration-friendly setup that the current leadership/laggard pattern broadly confirms.</p>
