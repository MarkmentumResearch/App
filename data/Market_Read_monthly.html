    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Monthly Market Read: February 19, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 65.2% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: lagging (avg -1.18%)</li>
<li>Financials: lagging (avg -3.46%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: lagging (avg -1.97%)</li>
<li>Health Care: leading (avg +1.24%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +1.13%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +5.34%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +4.67%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +9.27%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +6.83%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +2.85%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +8.07%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +3.28%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +1.16%)</li>
<li>Yields: soft (avg -3.96%)</li>
<li>Bonds: leading (avg +1.31%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: soft (avg -14.04%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is solid with roughly two-thirds of the universe positive, and leadership is skewed toward cyclicals and defensives together—Industrials, Materials, Energy, Utilities, Staples, Real Estate, and Health Care all outperforming—while typical growth and rate-sensitive areas like Tech, Financials, and Communication Services lag, suggesting investors are favoring balance-sheet quality, pricing power, and real-asset exposure over pure duration or beta. Macro posture shows growth expectations that are modest and increasingly differentiated across sectors while inflation expectations stay sticky rather than collapsing, as evidenced by falling yields, firm bonds, a stronger dollar, resilient gold, and a notably weaker energy complex, which together paint a mixed signal that the tape appears to be reconciling by rotating toward cash-flow visibility, defensive cyclicals, and hard-asset hedges rather than a straightforward risk-on or risk-off stance.</p>
