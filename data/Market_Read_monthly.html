    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Monthly Market Read: February 10, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 68.1% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: leading (avg +0.75%)</li>
<li>Financials: lagging (avg -1.49%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: soft (avg -0.39%)</li>
<li>Health Care: steady (avg +0.19%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +3.14%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +5.36%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +4.67%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +4.57%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +2.38%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +3.07%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +8.86%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (MTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +3.92%)</li>
<li>USD: firm (avg +0.13%)</li>
<li>Yields: soft (avg -2.36%)</li>
<li>Bonds: leading (avg +0.67%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: soft (avg -15.04%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: With roughly two-thirds of the universe positive MTD and strong, broad-based leadership across cyclicals (Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials) alongside defensives and rate-sensitives (Staples, Utilities, Real Estate), the tape is signaling healthy but somewhat cautious risk appetite, while lagging Financials and soft Communication Services point to some unease around the rate and profit outlook. Macro posture shows markets pricing slower growth and cooling inflation expectations—with falling yields, firm bonds, and a soft energy complex outweighing a firm USD and strong Gold—consistent with a tilt toward quality and rate-sensitive sectors even as cyclical participation remains robust.</p>
