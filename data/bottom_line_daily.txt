Bottom Line: Macro posture shows a firm USD, soft gold, flat yields, firm bonds, and a weak energy complex collectively lean toward subdued inflation expectations and only moderate growth, with sector leadership in Financials and rate-sensitive Real Estate partially contradicting the lower-inflation signal and leaving the overall read on growth somewhat mixed rather than decisively strong or weak.
