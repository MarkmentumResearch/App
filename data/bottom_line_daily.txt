Bottom Line: Macro posture shows lower-yield/higher-bond prices alongside strong gold and a firm energy complex with a stable dollar, which together point to mixed signals—growth expectations softening while inflation concerns remain elevated, favoring a more defensive, real-asset-oriented stance rather than an outright pro-cyclical risk-on regime.
