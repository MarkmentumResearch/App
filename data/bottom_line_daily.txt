Bottom Line: Macro conditions reflect a market pricing firmer growth and rising inflation pressures—evidenced by higher yields, a stronger USD, and a surging energy complex—tempered by strong gold as a hedge, with flat bonds and pro-cyclical sector leadership broadly confirming, though the simultaneous strength in both defensives and real assets keeps the signal from being cleanly one-way.
