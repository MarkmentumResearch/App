Bottom Line: Macro posture shows falling yields, firm bonds, strong gold, a flat dollar, and a soft energy complex together point to cooling growth expectations with rising demand for safety and some lingering inflation or policy-risk hedging rather than a clean pro-cyclical or disinflationary risk-on regime, a message largely corroborated by sector leadership skewed toward defensives over cyclicals.
