Bottom Line: Macro posture shows tighter financial conditions and firmer growth expectations with subdued inflation pressure, as higher yields and a stronger USD coincide with weak bonds, sharply lower energy and softer gold, a setup broadly validated by cyclical sector leadership but at odds with the Energy selloff, leaving inflation expectations skewed lower even as growth signals stay constructive.
