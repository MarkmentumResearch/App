Bottom Line: Macro posture shows lower yields with bonds leading, a softening in gold, a flat dollar, and a flat energy complex—together pointing to easing rate expectations and softer inflation pressures with only modest growth optimism, which is broadly consistent with the bid into defensives and duration-sensitive sectors but somewhat at odds with concurrent strength in cyclicals.
