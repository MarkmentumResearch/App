    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Weekly Market Read: February 19, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are WTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 53.8% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: lagging (avg -0.90%)</li>
<li>Financials: leading (avg +1.03%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: leading (avg +1.07%)</li>
<li>Health Care: leading (avg +0.87%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: soft (avg -0.28%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +0.73%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: lagging (avg -1.67%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +1.97%)</li>
<li>Utilities: lagging (avg -0.84%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: soft (avg -0.18%)</li>
<li>Materials: lagging (avg -1.17%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (WTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: lagging (avg -0.66%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +1.05%)</li>
<li>Yields: leading (avg +0.53%)</li>
<li>Bonds: flat (avg -0.03%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: leading (avg +0.69%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth was modestly positive with just over half of names higher, and leadership skewed toward Financials, Communication Services, Health Care, Industrials, and especially Energy, while classic defensives like Staples, Utilities, and parts of Materials lagged and rate‑sensitives such as Tech, Real Estate, and Consumer Discretionary traded soft to negative, consistent with a tape favoring cyclicals tied to higher rates and the commodity complex. Macro posture shows markets leaning toward firmer growth and firmer inflation expectations as a strong USD, higher yields, resilient energy complex, soft gold, and flat bonds together signal a preference for nominal growth exposure over duration, which this week’s sector leadership largely corroborates.</p>
