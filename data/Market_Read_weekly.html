    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Weekly Market Read: February 04, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are WTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 62.2% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: lagging (avg -2.40%)</li>
<li>Financials: soft (avg -0.34%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: lagging (avg -2.51%)</li>
<li>Health Care: firm (avg +0.39%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +2.18%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +3.04%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +4.11%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +3.21%)</li>
<li>Utilities: soft (avg -0.18%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: flat (avg +0.19%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +6.26%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (WTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +2.03%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +0.93%)</li>
<li>Yields: leading (avg +0.68%)</li>
<li>Bonds: lagging (avg -0.44%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: lagging (avg -11.21%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth improved with roughly three-fifths of the universe positive, and leadership skewed toward cyclicals and defensives together—Materials, Energy equities, Industrials, Consumer Staples, and Discretionary all outperformed—while classic growth/long-duration leadership in Tech and Communication Services lagged and rate-sensitives like Utilities and Real Estate failed to catch a strong bid despite higher yields. Macro posture shows growth expectations holding up but becoming more selective while inflation and policy-rate expectations stay firm or even edge higher, as evidenced by rising yields, a stronger USD, underperforming bonds and the energy complex, and concurrent strength in gold acting more as a hedge against policy and macro uncertainty than as a clean reflation signal, which the equity tape partially validates via cyclicals over secular growth but contradicts via the sharp drawdown in the broader energy complex.</p>
