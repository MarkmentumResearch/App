    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Weekly Market Read: February 11, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are WTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 64.3% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: leading (avg +1.29%)</li>
<li>Financials: lagging (avg -3.05%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: leading (avg +1.68%)</li>
<li>Health Care: lagging (avg -0.66%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: soft (avg -0.25%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +0.55%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +1.37%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +2.86%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +2.77%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +1.59%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +4.29%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (WTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +2.67%)</li>
<li>USD: lagging (avg -0.74%)</li>
<li>Yields: lagging (avg -0.84%)</li>
<li>Bonds: firm (avg +0.25%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: lagging (avg -2.34%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is solid with nearly two-thirds of the universe positive, and leadership is coming from a mix of cyclicals and defensives—Materials, Energy equities, Utilities, Staples, Real Estate, Tech, and Communication Services—while Financials and Health Care lag and Consumer Discretionary is soft, suggesting investors are favoring quality and duration over pure domestic growth leverage. Macro posture shows a weaker USD, falling yields, firmer bonds, and strong gold alongside a softer energy complex, together with this sector mix, point to easing growth expectations and rising concern about future inflation or financial conditions rather than a clean, synchronized growth upswing, which the tape is validating through outperformance in rate-sensitive and defensively tilted assets over classic pro-cyclical financials and consumer exposure.</p>
