    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Weekly Market Read: February 20, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are WTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 62.5% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: lagging (avg -0.62%)</li>
<li>Financials: leading (avg +1.65%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: leading (avg +2.08%)</li>
<li>Health Care: leading (avg +0.98%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +0.55%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +1.16%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: lagging (avg -1.28%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +2.29%)</li>
<li>Utilities: soft (avg -0.32%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: firm (avg +0.33%)</li>
<li>Materials: lagging (avg -1.04%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (WTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +1.30%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +0.94%)</li>
<li>Yields: leading (avg +0.83%)</li>
<li>Bonds: flat (avg -0.13%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: leading (avg +1.30%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth stayed constructive with nearly two-thirds of the universe positive, and leadership skewed toward risk-on and cyclicals as Financials, Communication Services, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, and Energy outperformed, while defensives were mixed with Health Care firm, Staples notably weak, and Utilities soft, and rate-sensitives like Real Estate holding up despite higher yields, signaling investors are still willing to lean into growth and earnings leverage rather than hide in pure safety. Macro posture shows markets are pricing a mix of firmer growth and stickier inflation pressures—higher yields alongside a strong USD, rising gold, and an advancing energy complex with largely flat bonds—leaving the week’s tape consistent with a modestly pro-growth but inflation-aware stance rather than an outright risk-off or disinflation trade.</p>
