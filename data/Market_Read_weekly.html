    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Weekly Market Read: February 18, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are WTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 56.5% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: flat (avg -0.07%)</li>
<li>Financials: leading (avg +1.89%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: leading (avg +0.70%)</li>
<li>Health Care: leading (avg +1.09%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +1.07%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +0.51%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: lagging (avg -1.25%)</li>
<li>Energy: firm (avg +0.49%)</li>
<li>Utilities: lagging (avg -1.94%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: firm (avg +0.22%)</li>
<li>Materials: lagging (avg -0.64%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (WTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: lagging (avg -0.94%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +0.86%)</li>
<li>Yields: leading (avg +0.60%)</li>
<li>Bonds: flat (avg -0.12%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: flat (avg -0.20%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth was modestly constructive with just over half of the universe positive, while leadership skewed toward cyclicals and risk-on groups—Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, Communication Services, Industrials, and a firm Energy and Real Estate tape—against notable underperformance in classic defensives like Utilities, Staples, and to a lesser extent Materials and Gold, even as Tech traded flat. Macro posture shows the combination of a stronger USD, rising yields, soft gold, and a mostly stable energy and bond complex aligning with the sector pattern to signal firmer growth expectations with contained-to-softening inflation pressures rather than a stagflation or overtly defensive setup.</p>
