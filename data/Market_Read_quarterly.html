    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Quarterly Market Read: February 17, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 68.5% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: firm (avg +2.58%)</li>
<li>Financials: heavy (avg -4.23%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: heavy (avg -4.69%)</li>
<li>Health Care: firm (avg +1.67%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: firm (avg +3.60%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +11.44%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +11.66%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +18.90%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +9.55%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +6.66%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +18.12%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: bid (avg +13.09%)</li>
<li>USD: falling (avg -1.18%)</li>
<li>Yields: falling (avg -2.92%)</li>
<li>Bonds: firm (avg +1.61%)</li>
<li>Energy Complex: firm (avg +3.28%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth remains solid with roughly two-thirds of the universe positive, and leadership is clustering in classic late-cycle and defensive havens—Energy, Materials, Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate—while Industrials and Consumer Discretionary are firm and growthy, and rate- and credit-sensitive Financials and Communication Services lag, painting a tape that prefers real assets and defensives over pure cyclicals and balance-sheet risk. Macro posture shows markets leaning toward slowing growth with persistent or re-accelerating inflation pressures as falling yields, a softer USD, firm bonds, a strong bid in gold, and a solid energy complex align with the sector rotation into inflation beneficiaries and defensives rather than a clean pro-cyclical reflation or outright growth-scare trade.</p>
