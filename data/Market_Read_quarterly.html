    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Quarterly Market Read: February 23, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 67.1% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: flat/firm (avg +1.31%)</li>
<li>Financials: heavy (avg -6.39%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: heavy (avg -4.24%)</li>
<li>Health Care: firm (avg +2.95%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: firm (avg +1.75%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +10.73%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +13.11%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +22.66%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +10.20%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +6.06%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +17.88%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: bid (avg +21.44%)</li>
<li>USD: soft (avg -0.59%)</li>
<li>Yields: falling (avg -3.30%)</li>
<li>Bonds: firm (avg +1.60%)</li>
<li>Energy Complex: bid (avg +6.37%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth remains solid with roughly two-thirds of the universe positive, but the character of leadership is defensive and real-asset heavy, with Energy, Materials, Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate all leading while Financials and Communication Services trade heavy and Tech only holds flat gains. That pattern, alongside firm Health Care and steady Consumer Discretionary, points to investors favoring cash-flow visibility, pricing power, and hard-asset exposure over pure cyclicality or balance-sheet leverage as the quarter progresses. Macro posture shows a falling dollar, lower yields, firm bonds, a strong energy complex, and a powerful bid in gold collectively signaling a market that is rotating toward assets that benefit from easier financial conditions and lingering inflation concerns even as growth expectations look increasingly cautious, which is consistent with the quarter-to-date tilt toward defensives and real assets over traditional growth and rate-sensitive financials.</p>
