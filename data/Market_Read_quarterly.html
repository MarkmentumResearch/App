    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Quarterly Market Read: February 19, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 69.7% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: firm (avg +2.94%)</li>
<li>Financials: heavy (avg -4.09%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: heavy (avg -4.06%)</li>
<li>Health Care: firm (avg +2.64%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: firm (avg +3.16%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +12.04%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +11.77%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +22.74%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +8.95%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +5.33%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +18.12%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: bid (avg +15.96%)</li>
<li>USD: flat (avg -0.39%)</li>
<li>Yields: falling (avg -2.27%)</li>
<li>Bonds: firm (avg +1.53%)</li>
<li>Energy Complex: bid (avg +6.82%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: With nearly 70% of the universe positive, breadth is solid and the tape is rewarding a broad mix of cyclicals and defensives, with leadership clustered in Energy, Materials, Industrials, Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, while Financials and Communication Services lag and Technology and Health Care grind higher alongside firm Consumer Discretionary. Macro posture shows markets are leaning toward slowing growth with persistent inflation pressures, as falling yields, firm bonds, and a flat dollar sit alongside a strong bid in gold and the energy complex, and the sector pattern of outsized gains in real assets, defensives, and rate-sensitives corroborates that investors are rotating toward assets that benefit from lower growth expectations but ongoing price and cost pressure.</p>
