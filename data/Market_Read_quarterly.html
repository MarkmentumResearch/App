    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Quarterly Market Read: February 11, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 71.7% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: leading (avg +4.53%)</li>
<li>Financials: heavy (avg -3.64%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: heavy (avg -3.26%)</li>
<li>Health Care: firm (avg +2.19%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +4.78%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +12.11%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +13.25%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +20.56%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +5.35%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +4.95%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +20.89%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: bid (avg +18.00%)</li>
<li>USD: falling (avg -1.34%)</li>
<li>Yields: flat (avg +0.01%)</li>
<li>Bonds: flat (avg +0.62%)</li>
<li>Energy Complex: bid (avg +7.28%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is healthy with over 70% of the universe positive, and leadership is notably broad-based, spanning cyclicals like Industrials, Energy, Materials, and Consumer Discretionary alongside defensives such as Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, while Financials and Communication Services lag despite firm participation from Health Care and Technology. Macro posture shows markets pricing in a weaker dollar, firm hard assets (gold and the energy complex) and stable rate expectations that together point to an environment of moderating but still positive growth with firmer inflation expectations, a setup that the tape is validating through simultaneous strength in real assets, select cyclicals, and classic defensives.</p>
