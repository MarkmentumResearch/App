    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Quarterly Market Read: February 13, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 68.3% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: firm (avg +3.82%)</li>
<li>Financials: heavy (avg -5.01%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: heavy (avg -4.83%)</li>
<li>Health Care: firm (avg +1.76%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: firm (avg +3.73%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +11.25%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +13.69%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +20.27%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +9.89%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +5.73%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +19.59%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: bid (avg +16.73%)</li>
<li>USD: falling (avg -1.42%)</li>
<li>Yields: falling (avg -2.79%)</li>
<li>Bonds: firm (avg +1.56%)</li>
<li>Energy Complex: bid (avg +5.84%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is solid with over two-thirds of the universe positive, while leadership is clustered in classic defensives and hard assets—Staples, Utilities, Real Estate, and especially Energy and Materials—alongside strong Industrials, as Financials and Communication Services trade heavy and Tech and Discretionary hold firm but not dominant, signaling a market that is rewarding balance-sheet quality, pricing power, and real-asset exposure over pure beta or leverage to credit. Macro posture shows a blend of easing growth and rising inflation expectations, with falling yields, a softer USD, firm bonds, and a strongly bid Gold and Energy complex indicating the market is rotating toward assets that benefit from lower real rates and persistent price pressures, which aligns with this quarter’s tilt toward defensives and real assets and away from rate- and credit-sensitive cyclicals.</p>
