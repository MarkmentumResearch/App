    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Quarterly Market Read: February 02, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 69.4% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: leading (avg +4.92%)</li>
<li>Financials: flat/firm (avg -0.32%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: soft (avg -2.79%)</li>
<li>Health Care: firm (avg +1.61%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: firm (avg +3.61%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +7.20%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +7.26%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +9.72%)</li>
<li>Utilities: flat/firm (avg +0.64%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: flat/firm (avg +1.07%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +9.96%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: bid (avg +7.78%)</li>
<li>USD: soft (avg -0.76%)</li>
<li>Yields: firm (avg +2.48%)</li>
<li>Bonds: flat (avg -0.20%)</li>
<li>Energy Complex: bid (avg +6.25%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is healthy with roughly two-thirds of the universe positive, and leadership skewed toward cyclicals and real assets—Energy and Materials at the top, joined by strong Industrials and solid Consumer Discretionary—while defensives like Staples also participate and rate-sensitives such as Utilities and Real Estate hold flat-to-firm, suggesting the tape is expressing a preference for economically levered exposure without abandoning quality. Information Technology continues to lead, Financials are essentially unchanged, and Communication Services is the notable laggard, which together point to a constructive but selective risk appetite rather than an across-the-board reach for beta. Macro posture shows markets are discounting a backdrop of firmer nominal growth with persistent inflation pressures—evidenced by a bid in gold and the energy complex, a softer USD, and firm yields alongside flat bonds—which lines up with the quarter’s rotation into cyclicals and real assets and helps explain why investors are rewarding both growth-sensitive and inflation-resilient sectors.</p>
