    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Quarterly Market Read: February 12, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 66.5% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: firm (avg +2.16%)</li>
<li>Financials: heavy (avg -5.42%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: heavy (avg -5.48%)</li>
<li>Health Care: flat/firm (avg +0.35%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: firm (avg +3.47%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +10.00%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +13.61%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +18.48%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +7.02%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +4.23%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +18.95%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: bid (avg +13.90%)</li>
<li>USD: falling (avg -1.37%)</li>
<li>Yields: falling (avg -1.73%)</li>
<li>Bonds: firm (avg +1.26%)</li>
<li>Energy Complex: bid (avg +5.92%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is solid with roughly two-thirds of the universe positive QTD, and leadership skewed toward classic late-cycle and real-asset beneficiaries—Energy and Materials up high teens, Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate all firmly higher—while cyclically geared Financials and Communication Services are under pressure and Technology/Discretionary are positive but not dominant, signaling a cautious rotation toward defensiveness and hard assets rather than a clean pro-growth chase. Macro posture shows the tape aligning with a weaker-growth, higher or stickier-inflation expectation set as falling yields and firm bonds pair with a falling USD, a strongly bid Gold complex, and a solidly positive Energy complex, with the sector mix broadly confirming that investors are favoring inflation hedges and defensives over financial cyclicals despite supportive rate dynamics.</p>
