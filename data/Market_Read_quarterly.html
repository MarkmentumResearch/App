    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Quarterly Market Read: February 04, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 70.3% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: flat/firm (avg +0.79%)</li>
<li>Financials: soft (avg -1.02%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: heavy (avg -4.59%)</li>
<li>Health Care: firm (avg +1.69%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +4.26%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +9.30%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +11.16%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +15.80%)</li>
<li>Utilities: firm (avg +1.94%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: firm (avg +2.53%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +16.18%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: bid (avg +14.55%)</li>
<li>USD: soft (avg -0.61%)</li>
<li>Yields: firm (avg +2.45%)</li>
<li>Bonds: flat (avg -0.23%)</li>
<li>Energy Complex: bid (avg +11.20%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: With roughly 70% of the universe positive, breadth is constructive and the tape is rewarding a mix of classic cyclicals and defensives, as leadership out of Materials, Energy, Industrials, Consumer Staples, and Consumer Discretionary pairs with firm Utilities, Real Estate, Health Care, and a resilient Tech tape, while Financials and Communication Services lag despite stable bonds and firmer yields. Macro posture shows growth expectations grinding higher alongside firmer inflation pressures, as a bid in Energy and Materials coincides with rising yields, a softer USD, and a powerful move in Gold that signals persistent demand for real assets and inflation hedges even as aggregate bond prices tread water, aligning broadly with the sector leadership mix but leaving cross-asset signals somewhat mixed rather than cleanly one-sided.</p>
