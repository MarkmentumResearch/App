    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Quarterly Market Read: February 18, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying (all numbers are QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 70.9% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: firm (avg +3.71%)</li>
<li>Financials: heavy (avg -3.26%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: heavy (avg -4.36%)</li>
<li>Health Care: firm (avg +2.86%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +4.59%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +11.72%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +12.22%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +20.92%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +7.71%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +5.73%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +18.80%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers (QTD % returns):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: bid (avg +15.64%)</li>
<li>USD: soft (avg -0.58%)</li>
<li>Yields: falling (avg -2.20%)</li>
<li>Bonds: firm (avg +1.44%)</li>
<li>Energy Complex: bid (avg +5.82%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth remains robust with over 70% of the universe positive QTD, and leadership is broadly distributed across cyclicals and real assets—Energy and Materials are standouts alongside strong Industrials and Discretionary—while defensives like Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate are also outperforming, and classic beta sectors like Financials and Communication Services are notably heavy even as Tech and Health Care remain constructive. Macro posture shows falling yields, firm bonds, a soft USD, and a strong bid in both Gold and the Energy complex pointing to easing growth expectations alongside elevated or re-accelerating inflation risk, a view that is largely corroborated by the tape’s preference for real assets and defensives over financials and more rate-sensitive risk.</p>
