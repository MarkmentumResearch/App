Bottom Line: Macro posture shows markets are leaning toward slower, stickier growth with mixed but generally firm inflation expectations, as higher USD and yields alongside weaker bonds and a slumping energy complex argue against a pure inflation scare even as resilient gold and the leadership of defensives and real-asset-linked cyclicals signal demand for hedges and cash-flow visibility rather than a broad-based reflation or robust growth upswing.
