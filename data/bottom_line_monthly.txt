Bottom Line: Macro posture shows that softer yields, bid bonds, a mildly firm USD, resilient gold, and a sharply weaker energy complex together signal cooling growth and moderating forward inflation pressures, which the sector pattern is validating via outperformance in defensives and rate-sensitives rather than in the high-beta cyclicals.
