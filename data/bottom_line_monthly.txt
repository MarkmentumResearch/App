Bottom Line: Macro posture shows growth expectations that are modest and increasingly differentiated across sectors while inflation expectations stay sticky rather than collapsing, as evidenced by falling yields, firm bonds, a stronger dollar, resilient gold, and a notably weaker energy complex, which together paint a mixed signal that the tape appears to be reconciling by rotating toward cash-flow visibility, defensive cyclicals, and hard-asset hedges rather than a straightforward risk-on or risk-off stance.
