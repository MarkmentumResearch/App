    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Daily Market Read: February 10, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 55.1% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: flat (avg +0.07%)</li>
<li>Financials: lagging (avg -0.65%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: leading (avg +1.60%)</li>
<li>Health Care: lagging (avg -0.54%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +0.87%)</li>
<li>Industrials: firm (avg +0.26%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: firm (avg +0.23%)</li>
<li>Energy: flat (avg -0.08%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +1.68%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +1.53%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +1.63%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: lagging (avg -0.99%)</li>
<li>USD: flat (avg -0.06%)</li>
<li>Yields: lagging (avg -1.17%)</li>
<li>Bonds: leading (avg +0.47%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: flat (avg -0.16%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth was moderately positive with just over half the universe green, while leadership skewed toward Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, Utilities, and Real Estate, suggesting a mix of cyclical participation and rate-sensitive outperformance, as Financials and Health Care lagged and Tech and Energy sat roughly flat. Macro posture shows lower yields with bonds leading, a softening in gold, a flat dollar, and a flat energy complex—together pointing to easing rate expectations and softer inflation pressures with only modest growth optimism, which is broadly consistent with the bid into defensives and duration-sensitive sectors but somewhat at odds with concurrent strength in cyclicals.</p>
