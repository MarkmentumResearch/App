    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Daily Market Read: February 24, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 71.1% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: leading (avg +1.48%)</li>
<li>Financials: leading (avg +0.87%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: leading (avg +1.04%)</li>
<li>Health Care: soft (avg -0.21%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +1.31%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +1.19%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +0.89%)</li>
<li>Energy: flat (avg +0.18%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +0.78%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: firm (avg +0.28%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +0.68%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: lagging (avg -1.39%)</li>
<li>USD: firm (avg +0.18%)</li>
<li>Yields: firm (avg +0.12%)</li>
<li>Bonds: firm (avg +0.05%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: lagging (avg -1.28%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Broad participation with over 70% of the universe positive and leadership concentrated in cyclicals and growth (Tech, Discretionary, Industrials, Financials, Communications) alongside solid defensives (Staples, Utilities) and a steady Real Estate tape points to a constructive risk tone, while softness in Health Care and flat Energy suggest the move is more about growth and duration than pure reflation. Macro posture shows firmer USD, yields, and bonds alongside weaker gold and a lagging energy complex point to the market nudging toward stronger real growth expectations with contained inflation pressures rather than a pronounced inflation scare, broadly consistent with cyclical sector strength but at odds with the lack of confirmation from the energy patch.</p>
