    <p>Daily Market Read: February 02, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 57.3% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: leading (avg +1.48%)</li>
<li>Financials: firm (avg +0.47%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: lagging (avg -0.51%)</li>
<li>Health Care: firm (avg +0.31%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +1.60%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +1.12%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: firm (avg +0.39%)</li>
<li>Energy: lagging (avg -2.22%)</li>
<li>Utilities: lagging (avg -1.37%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: lagging (avg -1.18%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +0.61%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: lagging (avg -4.00%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +0.78%)</li>
<li>Yields: leading (avg +0.70%)</li>
<li>Bonds: lagging (avg -0.41%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: lagging (avg -15.06%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth was constructive with a majority of the universe positive, and leadership tilted clearly toward cyclicals and growth-sensitive groups—Consumer Discretionary, Tech, Industrials, and Materials—while defensives like Staples and Health Care were merely firm and classic bond proxies (Utilities, Real Estate) plus Energy and Comm Services lagged, signaling a pro-growth, risk-on bias with little appetite for yield or commodity exposure. Macro posture shows tighter financial conditions and firmer growth expectations with subdued inflation pressure, as higher yields and a stronger USD coincide with weak bonds, sharply lower energy and softer gold, a setup broadly validated by cyclical sector leadership but at odds with the Energy selloff, leaving inflation expectations skewed lower even as growth signals stay constructive.</p>
