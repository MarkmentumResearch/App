    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Daily Market Read: February 20, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 68.5% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: firm (avg +0.26%)</li>
<li>Financials: leading (avg +0.60%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: leading (avg +0.99%)</li>
<li>Health Care: flat (avg +0.10%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +0.82%)</li>
<li>Industrials: firm (avg +0.43%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: firm (avg +0.39%)</li>
<li>Energy: firm (avg +0.31%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +0.52%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +0.52%)</li>
<li>Materials: flat (avg +0.15%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +1.97%)</li>
<li>USD: flat (avg -0.11%)</li>
<li>Yields: firm (avg +0.30%)</li>
<li>Bonds: flat (avg -0.10%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: leading (avg +0.68%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth remains solid with roughly two-thirds of the universe positive, and leadership skewed toward cyclicals and risk-on groups like Financials, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary, while defensives such as Utilities and Real Estate also outperform and most other sectors grind higher, suggesting a broad but somewhat cautious advance rather than a pure high-beta chase. Macro posture shows a pro-inflation, modestly pro-growth tilt with Gold and the Energy complex leading alongside firmer yields and a stable USD and bond tape, pointing to rising inflation expectations and still-resilient growth, broadly confirmed—but also partially hedged—by the concurrent strength in both cyclical sectors and classic defensives.</p>
