    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Daily Market Read: February 13, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 71.4% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: leading (avg +1.77%)</li>
<li>Financials: leading (avg +0.58%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: leading (avg +0.72%)</li>
<li>Health Care: leading (avg +1.43%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: firm (avg +0.29%)</li>
<li>Industrials: leading (avg +1.12%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: flat (avg +0.10%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +1.52%)</li>
<li>Utilities: leading (avg +2.71%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +1.45%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +0.58%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +2.49%)</li>
<li>USD: flat (avg -0.05%)</li>
<li>Yields: lagging (avg -1.08%)</li>
<li>Bonds: firm (avg +0.29%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: flat (avg -0.07%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth was strong with over 70% of the universe positive, and leadership was broad-based across cyclicals (Tech, Industrials, Financials, Energy, Materials) alongside solid participation from defensives and rate-sensitives (Health Care, Utilities, Real Estate), while Staples and the energy complex were more muted, pointing to a constructive risk tone with some bid for safety and duration. Macro conditions reflect falling yields, firm bonds, flat USD, a strong gold bid, and a non-confirming, flat energy complex—together signaling mixed but tilting-toward-slower growth expectations with contained to easing inflation rather than a classic reacceleration backdrop.</p>
