    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Daily Market Read: February 18, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 65.4% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: leading (avg +1.11%)</li>
<li>Financials: leading (avg +1.09%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: leading (avg +0.51%)</li>
<li>Health Care: leading (avg +1.20%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: leading (avg +1.10%)</li>
<li>Industrials: firm (avg +0.38%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: leading (avg +0.53%)</li>
<li>Energy: leading (avg +1.64%)</li>
<li>Utilities: lagging (avg -1.68%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: lagging (avg -0.65%)</li>
<li>Materials: leading (avg +0.57%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: leading (avg +2.25%)</li>
<li>USD: leading (avg +0.61%)</li>
<li>Yields: leading (avg +0.74%)</li>
<li>Bonds: flat (avg -0.16%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: leading (avg +2.30%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth is solid with roughly two-thirds of the universe positive, and leadership is broad-based across cyclicals (Tech, Financials, Discretionary, Energy, Materials, Industrials) as well as traditionally defensive Health Care and Staples, while rate-sensitive defensives like Utilities and Real Estate lag, indicating an equity tape that is comfortable with higher yields and risk. Macro conditions reflect a market pricing firmer growth and rising inflation pressures—evidenced by higher yields, a stronger USD, and a surging energy complex—tempered by strong gold as a hedge, with flat bonds and pro-cyclical sector leadership broadly confirming, though the simultaneous strength in both defensives and real assets keeps the signal from being cleanly one-way.</p>
