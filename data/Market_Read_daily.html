    <h2>Market Read</h2>

    <p>Daily Market Read: February 17, 2026</p>

    <p>The market is saying:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universe Breadth: 45.9% positive.</li>
<li>Information Technology: lagging (avg -1.16%)</li>
<li>Financials: leading (avg +0.81%)</li>
<li>Communication Services: flat (avg +0.19%)</li>
<li>Health Care: soft (avg -0.12%)</li>
<li>Consumer Discretionary: flat (avg -0.04%)</li>
<li>Industrials: flat (avg +0.14%)</li>
<li>Consumer Staples: lagging (avg -1.78%)</li>
<li>Energy: lagging (avg -1.13%)</li>
<li>Utilities: soft (avg -0.26%)</li>
<li>Real Estate: leading (avg +0.88%)</li>
<li>Materials: lagging (avg -1.21%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Macro levers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold: lagging (avg -3.12%)</li>
<li>USD: firm (avg +0.25%)</li>
<li>Yields: flat (avg -0.13%)</li>
<li>Bonds: firm (avg +0.04%)</li>
<li>Energy complex: lagging (avg -2.49%)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bottom line: Breadth was middling with fewer than half of names positive, as leadership in Financials and Real Estate alongside flat Industrials and Consumer Discretionary pointed to a modest bias toward cyclicals and rate-sensitives, while notable weakness in Technology, Staples, Energy, and Materials signaled rotation rather than a broad risk-on impulse and left defensives and real assets on the back foot. Macro posture shows a firm USD, soft gold, flat yields, firm bonds, and a weak energy complex collectively lean toward subdued inflation expectations and only moderate growth, with sector leadership in Financials and rate-sensitive Real Estate partially contradicting the lower-inflation signal and leaving the overall read on growth somewhat mixed rather than decisively strong or weak.</p>
